# World Cup 2026 Odds Dashboard — project guide

A single-page, fully client-side dashboard: model "fair" championship odds for all 48
teams vs live Polymarket prices, an interactive bracket simulator, live ESPN results that
condition the odds, and SQLite snapshots. Deploys to Vercel as one static `index.html`.

## Golden rule — `index.html` is GENERATED, never edit it by hand

The deploy file `index.html` is built by concatenating three sources. Editing it directly
will be overwritten on the next build. Always edit the **source files** and rebuild.

Source of truth:
- `ui_template.html` — all UI markup, CSS, and app JavaScript. Contains two placeholders,
  `/*__ENGINE__*/` and `/*__DATA__*/`, that the build replaces.
- `engine.js` — the Monte Carlo simulation engine (group stage + 48-team knockout bracket,
  results conditioning). Shared verbatim by Node (tests/calibration) and the browser.
- `calibrate.js` — defines the 48 teams + their bookmaker championship odds, de-vigs them,
  and fits team strength ratings so the simulation reproduces those odds. Writes `data.json`.
- `annexC_raw.txt` — the 495 official FIFA third-place routing combinations (parsed by calibrate.js).
- `assemble.js` — injects `engine.js` + `data.json` into `ui_template.html` → writes `index.html`.
- `verify.js` — math/logic unit tests (run in Node against `engine.js` + `data.json`).

## Build / test / deploy

```bash
npm install            # one-time: installs jsdom + sql.js (dev/test only)
npm run build          # assemble index.html from the sources (fast)
npm run test           # run the math/logic checks (expect "27 passed, 0 failed")
npm run rebuild        # re-run calibration THEN assemble (see below for when)
npm run deploy         # vercel --prod  (needs the Vercel CLI + login)
```

Typical loop: edit `ui_template.html` → `npm run build` → open `index.html` (serve over
http, see below) → `npm run deploy`.

### When to recalibrate (`npm run calibrate` / `npm run rebuild`)
Only when the **inputs to the model change**: updated sportsbook championship odds, a changed
team list, or a change to the engine's match model (`engine.js`). Calibration is a Monte
Carlo fit (~10–20 s) and rewrites `data.json` (ratings + the `Fair %` baseline). Pure UI/CSS
edits do **not** need recalibration — just `npm run build`.

To update the `Fair %` baseline odds: edit the `TEAMS` array in `calibrate.js` (the third
value per row is the American championship price), then `npm run rebuild`.

## Run locally (do NOT open index.html via file://)
The page fetches Polymarket, ESPN, and a SQLite CDN, and uses localStorage/IndexedDB — all of
which are flaky or blocked under `file://`. Serve it:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000   # then open http://localhost:8000/index.html
```
The `/api/*` proxy functions (see below) do **not** run under `python http.server` — the page
detects the 404 and falls back to fetching the upstreams directly, so local dev still works.
To exercise the proxy locally, use `vercel dev` instead.

## Live data sources (browser-side, no API keys)
Fetched **proxy-first** (`/api/*` below) with a **direct-upstream fallback**, so the app
survives upstream CORS changes in prod and still works in local `python http.server`:
- Polymarket prices: `/api/polymarket?slug=world-cup-winner` → `gamma-api.polymarket.com`
- Golden Boot odds: `/api/polymarket?slug=world-cup-golden-boot-winner` → `gamma-api.polymarket.com`
- Match results + scorers: `/api/espn?dates=YYYYMMDD` → `site.api.espn.com/.../fifa.world/scoreboard`
- SQLite engine (sql.js WASM): cdnjs (direct). All others are inlined / offline-capable.

## Serverless proxy (`api/`)
- `api/polymarket.js`, `api/espn.js` — Vercel functions that front the upstreams with a strict
  **allowlist** (only the two WC slugs / `YYYYMMDD` dates) and `Cache-Control: s-maxage`, so
  Vercel's CDN serves one shared cached copy to all visitors (cuts upstream calls + invocations).
- Free on the Vercel Hobby plan (1M invocations/mo, no overage charges).

## Deploy notes
- `index.html` + `vercel.json` + the `api/` functions are what run on Vercel; the rest is build/dev tooling.
- Static site + serverless functions, framework preset "Other", no build command, no env vars.

## Tests must stay green
After any change to `engine.js`, `calibrate.js`, or the conditioning logic in
`ui_template.html`, run `npm run test`. The suite checks: the 495 routing combinations are
valid, round-by-round probabilities are monotonic and sum correctly, the model reproduces the
de-vigged market within ~1pp, and results-conditioning behaves (eliminated team → ~0%).
